# hello-world
My first Repository
I'm committed to life long learning. My current interest is micro controllers like the Arduio and Paricle Photon. I'm very interested in the IoT. 
My first project was an Arduino battery monitor with current sensor and LCD display. 
My second project is a Particle Photon based weather station publishing to Wunderground.
